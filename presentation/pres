Fast communication learning through asymmetrical multiplayer videogames

Videogames are a learning tool

1. Game Design

players are divided in couriers and radio ops

couriers have to carry items from point a to point b

radio ops know where the items are and where they need to go

couriers don't know where the items are and radio ops don't know where the players are

The goal of the game is to carry all the items to their destination

2. Implementation

kinematic bicicle model

map:

blocks

blocks -> place

blocks -> place -> roads

blocks -> place -> roads -> rails

blocks -> place -> roads -> rails -> cars

networking:

UDP with reliability

optional retransmission

fragmentation

integrity checks

radio:

half duplex

buffers

video:

3. Testing

TDD

Multiplayer testing

Clumsy
